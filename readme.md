# gulp-process-if-modified

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wlarch/gulp-process-if-modified.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wlarch/gulp-process-if-modified) ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/gulp-process-if-modified)

> This gulp plugin will passthrough source files if they have been modified since last build.

_Inspired by [gulp-changed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-changed) and [gulp-changed-in-place](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/gulp-changed-in-place)_

## Avoid long running Gulp builds

Do not waste time during your build process when there is no reason to. This plugin will process all files in gulp.src() if at least one file was changed. This plugin uses the features of [node-file-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-file-cache) to keep track of the assets SHA1 hashed content in a cache.json file.

## Alternatives depending on use case

[gulp-changed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-changed) : checks against build files, for example ES5 files generated by Babel.js from the source ES6 files.

[gulp-changed-in-place](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/gulp-changed-in-place) : monitors source files, ES6 files for example. This allows you to do things like apply source formatting or linting *only* to changed files while you are working on them.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save gulp-process-if-modified
```

## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var processIfModified = require('gulp-process-if-modified');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var rename = require("gulp-rename");

// Styles example task
gulp.task(config.path + '-styles', () =>{

    var files = [
        'public/css/styles.scss',
        'public/css/custom.scss',
        'public/css/header.scss'
        'public/css/footer.scss'
    ];

    var css_build_path = 'public/build/css/';

    return gulp.src(files)
        .pipe(processIfModified({ cacheFilename: "styles" }))
        .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
        .pipe(rename('styles.min.css'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(css_build_path));
});
```

## API

### processIfModified({options})

#### `cacheFilename`
* `string`
* Default = `./cache/.cache-default.json`

  Cache filename for specific task. The name provided here will be prefixed with `.cache-`. Example : `special_task` as cacheFilename will create the following file in cache folder : `./cache/.cache-special_task.json`

#### `cacheLife`
* `int`
* Default = `1814400`

  Cache keys lifetime in seconds (default 3 weeks).

#### `basePath`
* `string`
* Default = `undefined`

  Allows you to set relative path that will be used for storing paths (keys) in the `cache`.

# Issues

* Be careful not to have multiple processes accessing the same cache file. In fact, it is sugested that each gulp task has it's own cache file by using the `cacheFilename` option above.
